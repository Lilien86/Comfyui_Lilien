## 🔍 Node Overview

> ### 🎛️ LatentInterpolatorMulti
>
> The **LatentInterpolatorMulti** node is a powerful and versatile tool for interpolating between two latent vectors using a variety of mathematical algorithms. It's perfect for generating smooth, visually appealing transitions within the latent space of models like GANs.
>
> #### 🌟 Key Features
>
> - **🌐 Multiple Interpolation Algorithms**: Choose from a range of interpolation methods, including:
>   - Linear
>   - Quadratic
>   - Cubic
>   - Sinusoidal
>   - Noise-Weighted
>   - Random-Weighted
>   - Per-Channel
>   - Logarithmic
> - **🎚️ Adjustable Mixing Factor**: Fine-tune the degree of interpolation with a customizable mixing factor to achieve your desired effect.
> - **⚙️ Automatic Compatibility Handling**: Automatically aligns latent vectors of differing dimensions or sizes, ensuring seamless interpolation.
>
> #### 🧩 Input Types
>
> - **latent1**: The first latent vector (`LATENT`).
> - **latent2**: The second latent vector (`LATENT`).
>
> #### ⚙️ Optional Parameters
>
> - **interpolation_algorithm**: Select the interpolation algorithm to apply. Options include:
>   - Linear
>   - Quadratic
>   - Cubic
>   - Sinusoidal
>   - Noise-Weighted
>   - Random-Weighted
>   - Per-Channel
>   - Logarithmic
> - **mixing_factor**: A float value between `0.0` and `1.0`, determining how much each latent vector influences the interpolation.
>
> #### 🎯 Output Types
>
> - **latent**: The resulting interpolated latent vector (`LATENT`).
>
> Dive into the world of creative interpolation and latent space exploration with the **LatentInterpolatorMulti** node!
